Generate electricity by placing biters on treadmills. Biters can be caught with cage traps, or by placing an egg extractor on a buried biter nest. Biters get tired after running on the treadmill after which they need be revitalized, which could be hazardous. Warning, biters might escape!

`This mod is still in it's early stages and might contains some (unintended) bugs and balance issues.`
## Features:

- **Treadmill Generator**: Generate power by placing biters on a treadmil-like device. This might have hazardous effects if the biter is tired, but device will still function optimally.
- **Revitalization Center**: A peaceful place where exhausted biters can relax and regain their strength. The methods might be questionable, but they get results!
- **Incubator**: Biters begin their live as eggs, and these devices are used to raise (grow?) strong biters to run in generators.
- **Egg Extractor**: Placed on a **Buried Biter Nest** these devices extract **Biter Eggs** that can later be carefully placed in **Incubators**.
- **Cage Trap**: Catch live biters in a cage trap! For those days that you don't want to wait around until all your eggs hatch.
