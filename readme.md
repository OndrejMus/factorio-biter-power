## Features:

- **Biter Generator**: Generate power by placing biters on a treadmil-like device. This might have hazardous effects if the biter is tired, but device will still function optimally.
- **Revitalization Center**: A peaceful place where exhausted biters can relax and regain their strength. The methods might be questionable, but they get results!
- **Incubator**: Biters begin their live as eggs, and these devices are used to raise (grow?) strong biters to run in generators.
- **Egg Extractor**: Placed on a **Buried Biter Nest** these devices extract **Biter Eggs** that can later be carefully placed in **Incubators**.
- **Cage Trap**: Catch live biters in a cage trap! For those days that you don't want to wait around until all your eggs hatch.
